## Activity feeds

Exposes RSS feeds of user activity on a Drupal site:

* activity/posts
* activity/updates
* activity/comments

A convenient way to consume these feeds is to use [Activity
Consumer](https://github.com/developmentseed/activity_consumer) module.

This is a custom module. A more generalized version would be based on
[Activity Streams](http://activitystrea.ms/).

## Views patches

The views/ directory contains extensions to Views that have been
submitted as patches to the Views issue queue:

* [#730752 Expose site info (site name, site base url) as field](http://drupal.org/node/730752)
* [#730810 Expose authmap table](http://drupal.org/node/730810)
